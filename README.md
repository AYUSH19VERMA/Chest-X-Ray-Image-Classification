## Objective 

## Results
In the analysis of this data, the number of labels for each disease was analysed. It was found that Infiltration had the highest number of labels (nearly 20,000) with the rest of the disease having very few labels in the entire image dataset of 112,120 images (Fig.5). About 60,361 images had labels of “No Finding” indicating a large irregularity in the dataset with respect to the disease labelling. Also there is no data regarding the presence of healthy patients in the data and whether these “No Findings” correspond to them or not. Thus, the overall authenticity of the dataset with respect to labelling for different types of diseases can’t be verified.
