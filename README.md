## Results
In the analysis of this data, the number of labels for each disease was analysed. It was found that Infiltration had the highest number of labels (nearly 20,000) with the rest of the disease having very few labels in the entire image dataset of 112,120 images. About 60,361 images had labels of “No Finding” indicating a large irregularity in the dataset with respect to the disease labelling. Also there is no data regarding the presence of healthy patients in the data and whether these “No Findings” correspond to them or not. Thus, the overall authenticity of the dataset with respect to labelling for different types of diseases can’t be verified.

Further looking at the image dimensions in Fig. 6, the mean of image width was observed to be 2646 mm and image height was observed to be 2486 mm. The distribution of the image width and image height was observed to be in a distribution of less than 20% around the mean, thus indicating a reasonable dataset which can be used without much pre-processing.

The dataset segmentation by gender shows nearly 63340 male data and 48780 female data in the images as shown in Fig.7 a, implying a proportionate collection of data from both the genders. Also, the dataset segmentation by view shows 67310 images in the Posterior-anterior view and 44810 images in the anterior-posterior views as shown.
